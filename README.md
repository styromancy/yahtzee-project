# yahtzee project
 Yahtzee-sorta project that I created with a friend in high school. Intended to run in the IDLE module that comes with Python.
Includes many disparate little projects that I created during my time in high school, such as a basic random word generator that uses a Markov chain that was "trained" on one of the corpora in the Natural Language Tool Kit. 
My personal highlight for this game is the Johnny Bravo mode.
